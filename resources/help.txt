        It supports glob matching (? for any singe char, * for any
        number of any char). If provided it will be matched against
        the auto-scaling group names.

    By tag:  tag:<tag-name>=<tag-value>
        It matches the auto-scaling groups with have a tag which
        matches the given tag-name and tag-value pair.
        Examples:

           tag:resilient=true
           tag:KillMe='try it'

    --default-selection

        the following name/value `chaos-testing=opt-in`.
        Practically, it is the same as: `tag:chaos-testing=opt-in`

ATTACKS

    The only supported attack currently is the termination of one
    instance in a auto-scaling group.
