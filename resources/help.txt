SYNOPSIS

    bad-boy [global-options] [TARGET...]

DESCRIPTION

    bad-boy is a Chaos testing tool. It generates artificial failures
    and other perturbations is the infrastructure to test how
    applications handle such scenarios.

GLOBAL-OPTIONS

    -h, --help
        It displays this page.


    -v, --version
        It shows bad-boy's version.


    --dryrun, --dry-run
        It simulate the execution without performing the attack.


    --killer-run [<group>], (default: all)
        It runs continuously and attacks based on a configuration
        group. The optional parameter is the name of the configuration
        in which you can define the attack rate in terms of the
        percentage of the targets that will be attacked in a given
        period. The default group is `all` and the attack rate is set
        as `[0.30 :daily]` which means that 30%% of the targets will be
        attacked on daily basis.
        It can be used in conjunction with the targets selection, and
        the default selection is same as preset `--default-selection`


TARGET

    There are multiple ways to select the which part of your
    infrastructure will be under attack.

    By name: web-app* or booking-asg
        It supports glob matching (? for any singe char, * for any
        number of any char). If provided it will be matched against
        the auto-scaling group names.

    By tag:  tag:<tag-name>=<tag-value>
        It matches the auto-scaling groups with have a tag which
        matches the given tag-name and tag-value pair.
        Examples:
           tag:Foo=bar
           tag:resilient=true
           tag:KillMe='try it'

    --default-selection
        It matches the auto-scaling groups with have a tag with
        the following name/value `chaos-testing=opt-in`.
        Practically, it is the same as: `tag:chaos-testing=opt-in`

ATTACKS

    The only supported attack currently is the termination of one
    instance in a auto-scaling group.
